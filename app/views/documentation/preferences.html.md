# Preferences

Outages puts control of notifications
in the hands of the receiver of the messages.
The preferences page is where the user
controls how what type of information to receive.

All users receive notifications
about outages that are of interest to them
on most pages of the Outages application.
Users can also choose to receive notifications by e-mail.

## Notification Preferences

<dl>
<dt>
Notify me about new or changed outages associated with anything I'm watching
</dt>
<dd>
Notify the user when the outage's description,
name,
start or end date or time change.
</dd>
<dt>
Notify me when notes are added, changed, or deleted.
</dt>
<dd>
Notify the user when notes attached to the outage
are added, changed, or deleted.
Often notes are used to have a conversation about the outage
while it's being planned.
Only some users may need to see all the discussion,
so this option allows them to be notified as the discussion evolves.
</dd>
<dt>
Notify me when the outage is completed.
</dt>
<dd>
As the name says.
</dd>
<dt>
Notify me when the outage is not completed by its scheduled end time.
</dt>
<dd>
Also as the name says.
One use case for this option
is for managers who might need to support the team
if things aren't going according to plan.
</dd>
<dt>
Notify me <i>x</i> <i>units</i> before outage starts
</dt>
<dd>
Send a reminder notification a certain number of
hours, days, weeks, or months,
before the outage starts.
</dd>
</dl>

## E-Mail Notification Preferences

<dl>
<dt>
Also notify me by e-mail.
</dt>
<dd>
Selecting this causes e-mail notifications to be sent
to the user's e-mail account they use to log in.
</dd>
<dt>
Individual e-mail for each outage
</dt>
<dd>
This causes one e-mail to be sent for each notification.
This option may generate more e-mail for the user,
but provides more immediate notification.
For example, by setting
"Notify me when the outage is not completed by its scheduled end time"
and selecting this type of e-mail notification,
the user will get an e-mail as soon as the outage runs over its end time.
</dd>
<dt>
One e-mail per day at <i>time</i>
</dt>
<dd>
This reduces all the notifications into a digest of notifications
once a day, at the specified time.
This may be more useful for a manager who's monitoring
a lot of different services,
but doesn't need to be actively dealing with individual outages
on an immediate basis.
</dd>
</dl>
