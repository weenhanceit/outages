We'd like to hear from you

While Outages is in an alpha state
(meaning the application is new,
features are being experimented on all the time,
and bugs are being worked out),
it's free.
We welcome you to try the application,
and give us your feedback.

If there is anything that you like about the application, or more importantly,
if there is anything that you don't like, find confusing, missing or feel can
be improved upon, we would really like to hear from you.

Please send us an email with all of your comments to
<%= mail_to "info@weenhanceit.com","info@weenhanceit.com", subject: "Feedback for Outages" %>.

If you are a Git Hub user and would like to create an issue in the Outages
repository, we would welcome your feedback at
<%= link_to "github.com/weenhanceit/outages/issues","https://github.com/weenhanceit/outages/issues",
