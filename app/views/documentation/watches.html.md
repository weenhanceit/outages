# Watches

A user sets up a "watch" on a service
if they're interested in hearing about Outages
that affect the service.
Once a user sets an watch on a service,
they receive notifications
based on their
<%= link_to "preferences", documentation_preferences_path %>.

To set a watch on a service,
go to the
<%= link_to_if_logged_in "Services", cis_path %>
page,
and select the "Watch?" check box
for the service or services of interest.
