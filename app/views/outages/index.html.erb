<p>Calendar of outages, or spreadsheet-like view of outages.</p>

  By default you're seeing the list of outages that affect the CIs you're watching,
  that happen in the next two weeks.

<h2>Filters</h2>
<div class="content-note">
    Filters Allow the user to limit the outages displayed on the grid or in the calendar.  Outages
    displayed must match EACH of the 3 criteria below.

    The page will be refreshed when any of the following are changed

    <div class="content-note">
        Outages meet this criteria if the Outage Short Description, Outage Long
        Description, Outage Status contains this fragment, if any of the Notes
        associated with an Outage contain the fragment or if any of the
        associated CIs Name, Description, Tags contains this fragment.

    Still not sure that this would be "logically" clear to users (because it is
    a bit of an "AND/OR".  Wondering if this should simply be 'all' or 'watched/edited by me' radio button)

      If a latest time is provided, show outages that don't start after the end_time.
      If the latest time is blank, the outage start time is a don't care.

    <p>
      If both times are provided, show the intersection of the above, or actually,
      do both of the above tests in the same query.
    </p>
    <p>
      Or to put it another way, show all outages that overlap the filter's start
      and end times.

<h4>Notes, Issues, Questions, Futures</h4>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Problem: Entering a blank name means that no link appears for the
    outage and it can't be edited.
  </strong></li>
  <li><strong>
      Problem: Entering a blank date causes this page to fail
      </strong>
  </li>
  <li><strong>
      Note/Question: After Edit save, redirected to Services.  Suggest should
      redirect to Outages, but not sure of Larry's thinking
      </strong>
  </li>

  <li>
    There are at least 3 options for long lists:
      <ul>
          <li>An intermediate page with the whole list (overlay)</li>
          <li>Max height plus scroll bar</li>
          <li>Jump to Outages page, where whole list is displayed.</li>
        </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    What option might there be for the calendar?  Presumably the calendar may be
    scrolled back and forth through time - but what options will there for
    the period of time displayed? Will these be user preferences or will we
    default to showing weeks and the weeks displayed cover the period of time
    set by the filter above?
  </li>
  <li>
    Likely should add a filter for Completed
  </li>
  <li>Filters: Show me what's changed (TBC)</li>
  <li>Maybe more filters?</li>
  <li>
    Should remember the filters for each user so when they come back
    to the page, whether it is this session or a new session, the filter
    will be the same
  </li>
  <li>
    Need to design a graceful way to handle the situations where the user
    sets filters to return too much data (paging?), or the calendar range
    is set so long as to return a ridiculous number of weeks (max before today,
    max after today as limits?)
  </li>
  <li>
    Outages that have an active, on-line notification will be highlighted
    somehow (bold or backgroun colour?).
  </li>
  <li>
    Future: Preference to automatically acknowledge and notifications
    that too old.
  </li>
</ul>
